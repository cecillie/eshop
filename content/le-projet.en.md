# The project

*When your morale is low, when the day seems dark to you,  
When work becomes monotonous, when hope is not there,  
Get on a bike and ride without thinking about anything other than the path you are taking.*

*Arthur Conan Doyle*

## At the beginning

It was in the fall of 2020, during the second lockdown, that I started jotting down people on bikes. So frustrated at not being able to pedal freely, I tried to compensate for my lack of cycling through illustrations, trying to transcribe this feeling of freedom and joy that comes from cycling.
A little out of curiosity, I posted a first illustration on twitter, then another… the enthusiasm of the cyclosphere was so encouraging that, following several requests, I decided to offer a few A3 and A5 prints. Without really believing it, I launched [my Ulule page](https://fr.ulule.com/paysages-a-velo/) on November 28th.  
And there, ̶P̶A̶F̶ PSCHITT !! The goal reached 200% in less than 24 hours!  
As much to admit, I panicked a LITTLE like when I ride on a secondary road without a cycle path. I had promised deliveries before Christmas, and now I find myself with dozens and dozens of packages to prepare. So I put on my best lycra and became a regular at the Carré Pro post office throughout the month of December. The 142 orders arrived safely and the Ulule campaign ended with a final goal of 473%.  
After this Ulule campaign, which ran like a Nexus 8, I started working on new illustrations to bring the Paysages à Vélo online store to life.

## Cycling landscapes

Through this series, I try to transcribe simple moments of life on a bicycle: there are so many different uses, people, roads and landscapes! The use of the bicycle is so beneficial that it is precious for me to share positive feelings: simplicity, good humor, fun and sharing.
On the graphic side, I like to work with these solid shapes and solid areas of color. Technically, this is a real challenge for me who am used to drawing with lines, but it allows the colors to fully live without them being enclosed by thick black outlines. I realize all my illustrations with vivid and expressionist nuances, which give a dreamlike aspect to these simple moments of life.  
I start by scribbling a first sketch in Posca first, then use the Procreate software and an iPad pro to continue my illustration. I also always do a photographic research work for the landscapes, the positions of the characters and for the choice of the frame!

## The author

My name is [Cécile Ricordeau](https://www.cecillie.fr/), aka "[cecillie](https://twitter.com/onibd)", and I am artistic director and freelance illustrator in Montreuil. From visual identity to website, including packaging and advertising campaigns, I worked for 15 years in different Parisian agencies, as artistic director and then creative director. I ended up finding my balance practicing on my own, a position that allows me to be more creative and freer.  
On the little queen side, I have been a moped machine for years, and my little family is 100% cycling every day. Our garage has a *Genesis* (my flawless bike), a *Petit Porteur* (my crush), a *Louison Bobet* (my darling), a *Kalkhoff* and a *Bullitt* (the SUV of [Narno](https://twitter.com/Narno)), our son’s *Btwin* and his *Puky* balance bike that we can’t seem to part with.  
With this project, I combine three things that I love: drawing, cycling and working with colors. I hope these series will please, and that this is only the start of a great project!
