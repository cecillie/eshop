This page does not exist, but while waiting for you to find what you went looking for, I will leave you with this thought from Ã‰mile Zola:

*I like the bicycle for the oblivion it gives. No matter how much I walk, I think. On my bicycle I go in the wind, I no longer think about it, and nothing is so delicious at rest.*

Emile Zola
